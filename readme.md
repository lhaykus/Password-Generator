Password Generator 

For this project, we were to use Javascript to create a password generator for users to produce random passwords if they need. The password generator starts by asking how long the user would like their password to be choosing between 8-128 characters long. There are then multiple prompts used to ask the user whether they want to include lower case letters, uppercase letters, numbers and/or special characters. When the user pressed the generate password button, a random password is generated for them to use.
